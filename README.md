# heart-disease-classification
We have a data which classify the patients whether they have a heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use logistic regression (classification) algorithm.


Data contains <br>

* age - age in years <br>
* sex - (1 = male; 0 = female) <br>
* cp - chest pain type <br>
* trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) <br>
* chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl <br>
* fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) <br>
* restecg - resting electrocardiographic results <br>
* thalach - maximum heart rate achieved <br>
* exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) <br>
* oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest <br>
* slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment <br>
* ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy <br>
* thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect <br>
* target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
